```{r, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
hp_data <- read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")

hp_data 
```

I'm in lab week 6


2. Basic wrangling and make graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates

```{r}

hp_graph <- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") + # position makes split columns in column graph vs. stacked
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Book", y = "Aggression Rate")

hp_graph

```
